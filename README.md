### Welcome to RTXI!

<a href="http://rtxi.org">The Real-Time eXperiment Interface (RTXI)</a> is a
collaborative open-source software development project aimed at producing a
real-time Linux based software system for hard real-time data acquisition and
control applications in biological research.

RTXI uses the open source <a href="http://xenomai.org">Xenomai framework</a> to
implement communication with a variety of commercially available multifunction
DAQ cards with both analog and digital input and output channels. This makes
RTXI essentially hardware-agnostic and able to communicate with multiple
actuators and sensors that may span different modalities.  

At the heart of RTXI is a dynamic framework allowing for easy creation and use
of modules. Each module features its own encapsulated interface through which
users can control module execution and modify its various parameters. Modules
contain function-specific code that can be used in combinations to build custom
workflows and experiment protocols. They are compiled outside the core RTXI
source tree as shared object libraries that are linked at runtime. Take a look

for more information on the architecture of RTXI and 
<a href="http://rtxi.org/modules/">here</a> for the modules currently
available. 

To get started, please refer to our 
<a href="http://rtxi.org/docs/">documentation</a>. If you encounter any bugs or
have new feature requests, post them to the 
<a href="https://github.com/RTXI/rtxi/issues">issues section</a> and we'll help
you get started.
